## Thoughts on using this.

- Swift tooling on VSCode is atrocious. It constantly gets bogged down in WSL2. This could be a WSL2 issue, but I do know Go ran fine.
- Using an ORM was a mistake, it brings in a horrible programming model if you don't want to do exact thing it was made for.
- Vapor testing is weirdly structured and wraps stuff too much.
- Didn't really test out error handling, so TBD on whether I like that.

## Benchmarking

Breakpoint test with k6 crashed at about 950 VUs.
Memory usage was around 75 MiB.

# FeedcatterGRPC

ðŸ’§ A project built with grpc-swift-2.

## Thoughts on using this.

- Swift tooling on VSCode is atrocious. It constantly gets bogged down in WSL2. This could be a WSL2 issue, but I do know Go ran fine.
- Swift VSCode tooling can't figure out that a bunch of stuff actually compiles. (incl cannot find my Proto imports)
- Swift proto package keeps putting .pb.d and .pb.o files into project root.

## Benchmarking

### Breakpoint
Breakpoint test with k6 ran fine up to 10000 VUs (there's more headroom to test for).
Memory usage was wack, though (1.2 GiB).
